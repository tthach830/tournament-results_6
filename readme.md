In this project, you’ll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.


The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired 
with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), 
and writing the code that will use it.

tournament.sql is where you will put the database schema, in the form of SQL create table commands.
tournament.py 
is where you will put the code of your module. In this file you’ll see stubs of several functions. Each function has a docstring that says what it should do.
Tournament_test.py contains unit tests that will test the functions you’ve written in tournament.py. 
You can run the tests from the command line, using the command ./tour.sh or python tournament_test.py




1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox

2. Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository

3. Launch the Vagrant VM

4. Run ./tour.sh to write SQL database and the tournament_test.py
